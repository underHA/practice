# practice 
## Instructions
**IMPORTANT**: In this practice situation, do *NOT* use the github.com website to directly edit or upload anything. 

It's really important that you're able to do everything from your own computer (GitKraken or command line) so that you're able to share your changes or update your code more quickly.

1. **Clone** this repository to your computer, I'd suggest using GitKraken.
2. Please take a look at the [GitHub Markdown formatting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), I'd suggest a light skim. We will need this for our final hackathon write-up! **Add your name to the bottom of this document** with some fancy **_styling_** to indicate your understanding.
3. Add an image to the *images* folder.
4. To finish, please **commit** and **push** your changes to the **main** branch. Add a meaningful commit message! (I'd usually summarize all my file changes)
5. If you see your changes on https://github.com/underHA/practice, you're done!
